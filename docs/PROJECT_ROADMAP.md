# ðŸŽ¯ CORTEX Project Roadmap & Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
CORTEX (Collaborative Orchestration Runtime for Task EXecution) transforms Claude into a multi-agent AI conductor orchestrating specialized delegates across distributed computing resources. This document outlines the comprehensive plan to bring CORTEX from its current infrastructure setup phase to production readiness.

## Project Timeline: 12 Weeks to Production

### Current Status: Infrastructure Phase (40% Complete)
- **Date**: June 15, 2025
- **Phase**: 2 of 5
- **Overall Progress**: ~25%

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### ðŸš€ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 24-48 Hours)

#### 1. Complete InfluxDB Integration
```bash
# Access InfluxDB UI
http://localhost:8086

# Create organization: cortex
# Create buckets: metrics, n8n-metrics, system-metrics, ai-metrics
# Generate All-Access token
# Update .env file with INFLUX_TOKEN
```

#### 2. Sequential Service Startup
```bash
# Start core databases first
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# Verify health
docker-compose ps

# Start graph and vector stores
docker-compose up -d neo4j qdrant

# Finally, start n8n
docker-compose up -d n8n
```

#### 3. Fix Monitoring Stack
```yaml
# Update monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml
# Fix Tempo and Mimir configurations
# Restart with proper retention settings
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Service Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Incremental integration with extensive testing
   - Fallback: Simplified direct API calls if n8n issues arise

2. **Multi-Machine Coordination**
   - Mitigation: Start with single-machine deployment
   - Fallback: Cloud-based coordination service

3. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Mitigation: Early load testing and profiling
   - Fallback: Horizontal scaling strategies

### Resource Risks
1. **Time Constraints**
   - Mitigation: Prioritized feature development
   - Fallback: MVP with core pipelines only

2. **Complexity Growth**
   - Mitigation: Regular architecture reviews
   - Fallback: Service consolidation if needed

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Complete InfluxDB Setup**
   - Get API token from UI
   - Configure Grafana datasource
   - Test metric ingestion

2. **Start Core Services**
   - Follow sequential startup order
   - Verify health checks
   - Test inter-service connectivity

3. **Begin n8n Configuration**
   - Access UI and set credentials
   - Create first test workflow
   - Configure webhook endpoints

4. **Update Progress Tracking**
   - Mark completed tasks in PROGRESS.md
   - Document any blockers
   - Plan next session goals
