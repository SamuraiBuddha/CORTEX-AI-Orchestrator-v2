# ðŸ§  CORTEX Development Session - June 14, 2025

## Session Summary

This document captures the development session between Claude and SamuraiBuddha (Jordan Paul Ehrig) on the inception of CORTEX - Collaborative Orchestration Runtime for Task EXecution.

## Vision

Transform Claude into a multi-agent AI conductor orchestrating specialized delegates across distributed computing resources using n8n workflows.

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. **MCP Tool Discovery**
We cataloged the extensive MCP toolkit available:
- GitHub integration (issues, PRs, code management)
- Academic paper access (arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, PubMed)
- Documentation tools (library docs, NPM packages)
- Browser automation (Playwright-like control)
- Azure tools (App Config, Cosmos DB, Storage, AI Search)
- Docker orchestration
- File system operations
- Knowledge graph management
- And many more...

### 2. **Architecture Decision: n8n vs Direct MCP**
We chose n8n over direct Claude Desktop MCP integration because:
- **Visual workflow design** - No code orchestration
- **Distributed processing** - Load balance across 3 machines
- **Agent delegation** - Route to specialized models (Ollama, DeepSeek, Codestral)
- **Error handling** - Retry logic and fallbacks
- **Caching layer** - Redis for performance
- **Monitoring** - Grafana/Prometheus integration
- **Flexibility** - Mix cloud and local resources

### 3. **Hardware Setup**
Three powerful machines:
- Machine 1: i9 11th Gen, 64GB RAM, RTX 3090
- Machine 2: i9 11th Gen, 128GB RAM, RTX A5000
- Machine 3: Ryzen 9 5950X, 128GB RAM, RTX A4000
- 10GbE network backbone
- Terramaster NAS

### 4. **Discovered MCPs of Interest**
- **Blender MCP** - 3D modeling automation
- **Sequential Thinking** - Complex problem solving
- **Vector Databases** (Qdrant, Milvus, Chroma)
- **OctoEverywhere** - 3D printer control
- **Any Chat Completions** - Multi-AI provider access
- **Home Assistant** - Workspace automation
- **Memory MCP** - Persistent context

### 5. **Archon Discovery**
Found coleam00's Archon project (4,890 stars!) - "World's first Agenteer":
- AI agent that builds other AI agents
- Uses LangGraph for orchestration
- Multi-agent refinement system
- MCP server integration
- Comprehensive Streamlit UI
- Docker deployment

Key insights from Archon:
- Agent coordination patterns
- Iterative refinement with human-in-the-loop
- Tool library management
- UI/UX design patterns

## Current State

1. **Repository Created**: https://github.com/SamuraiBuddha/CORTEX-AI-Orchestrator
2. **Basic Structure**: README, docker-compose.yml, .env.example, LICENSE
3. **Workflow Templates**: Master dispatcher concept defined
4. **Architecture Planned**: Multi-pipeline system (CAD/3D, Code, Research, Data)

## Exit Point ðŸšª

We're pausing here with:
- CORTEX repository initialized
- Architecture and vision documented
- Archon project analyzed for insights
- Ready to explore coleam00's self-hosted-ai-starter-kit

## Entry Point for Next Session ðŸŽ¯

### Start Next Conversation With:
"I've reviewed the CORTEX Development Session 1 document. Let's continue from where we left off with exploring coleam00's self-hosted-ai-starter-kit and implementing the core workflows."
