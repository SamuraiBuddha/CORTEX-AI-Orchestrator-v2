# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Contact Information
- **Primary Contact:** Jordan Ehrig - jordan@ehrig.dev
- **Response Time:** Within 24 hours for critical issues
- **Secure Communication:** Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting

## Vulnerability Handling

### Severity Levels
- **Critical:** Remote code execution, data breach potential, orchestration compromise
- **High:** Privilege escalation, authentication bypass, credential exposure
- **Medium:** Information disclosure, denial of service, resource exhaustion
- **Low:** Minor issues with limited impact

### Response Timeline
- **Critical:** 24 hours
- **High:** 72 hours  
- **Medium:** 1 week
- **Low:** 2 weeks

## Security Measures

### Container Orchestration Security
- Secure Docker container configuration
- Network isolation and segmentation
- Resource limits and quotas enforcement
- Container image vulnerability scanning
- Secret management via environment variables
- Non-root container execution where possible

### AI Workflow Security
- Secure n8n workflow configuration
- Input validation for workflow triggers
- Authentication and authorization controls
- API endpoint security and rate limiting
- Workflow execution monitoring
- Data sanitization in AI operations

### Database Security
- PostgreSQL security hardening
- Encrypted database connections
- Database user privilege separation
- Regular security patches and updates
- Backup encryption and secure storage
- Access logging and monitoring

### Shell Script Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure environment variable handling
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Script execution privilege control
- Error handling to prevent information disclosure
- Command injection prevention
